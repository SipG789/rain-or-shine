## Weather Dashboard Application 

### In this application the user is able to add a city name and your daily forecast will display. Alongside that your weekly 5 day forecast will appear. 

###  You will notice that I used plain vanilla javascript. I went with what I know and the code is super long and could use some refactoring but I ran out of time and did the best with what I know. 

### I went to office hours and spoke with a few classmates for guidance but other than that this is straight off the dome. No internet or references. I wanted a challenge and I think I did pretty good. It is not perfect in any way and I am missing a few features. But I am proud of what I did here. 


The following is a screenshot of the application.
